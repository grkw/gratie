Jordan:

* add support to read and parse a file with a comma-separated list of colors (newline 
  indicates a new row in the grid)
* create simple repl to run interpreter (e.g., `step` or `run` commands)

```
./gratie -d <program>

> step
> pcb
> print grid
> print value at an index
```

Example debugger commands:

* print color block (index argument): show all codels in that block

Grace:

* implement floodfill for finding all codels in a color block
